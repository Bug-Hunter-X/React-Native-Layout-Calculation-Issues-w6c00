This error occurs when you use a component that doesn't properly handle the `onLayout` event or when there's a race condition between layout calculations and state updates.  The layout calculation might not have completed before the component tries to access layout dimensions, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes. This is common in scenarios involving dynamic content sizing or animations.
